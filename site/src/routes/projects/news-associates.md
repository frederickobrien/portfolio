For a year I taught the data journalism module at [News Associates](https://newsassociates.co.uk/data-journalism/) journalism school as part of its NCTJ course.

The syllabus included sourcing and scrubbing datasets, working with spreadsheet editors, and data visualisation. Lessons were delivered both remotely and in person at the News Associates office in Twickenham.
