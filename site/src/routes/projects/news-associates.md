I teach the [data journalism module](https://newsassociates.co.uk/data-journalism/) at News Associates journalism school as part of its NCTJ syllabus.

Topics covered include sourcing datasets, working with spreadsheet editors, and data visualisation, with lessons delivered both remotely and in person at the News Associates office in Twickenham.
