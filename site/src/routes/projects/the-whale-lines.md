A fake news paper, _The Whale-Lines_ publishes stories that are almost as absurd and silly as real life. It has been a handy outlet for me since _The Onion_ mysteriously doesn't respond to my emails, letters, or notes written on bricks thrown through their office window.

The name comes from one of my favourite passages in Herman Melville's novel [_Moby-Dick_](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701):

> All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, everpresent perils of life.

Built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), _The Whale-Lines_ is the first website I made entirely on my own.

I harbour ambitions of one day putting together a printed edition and distributing it at Speakers' Corner in London.
