I occassionally do voice acting for [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/), a volunteer-led effort to create audiobooks in the public domain. Audio is recorded at home and edited using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

Authors whose works I've narrated include:

- Victor Hugo
- Anton Chekhov
- Jack London
