Gonzo Engineering is a project devoted to building free, open source tools for the benefit of journalists, musicians, and other members of the freak kingdom. It is guided by the idea that technology should work in support of keen minds - not instead of them.

All code is publically available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gonzo-engineering). There have been a couple of ventures so far.

## teeline.online

[teeline.online](https://teeline.online) is an online resource for studying Teeline shorthand. Features include searchable dictionary of hundreds of animated outlines, a 'revise' page where people can sear outlines into their brains, a basic syllabus outlining how Teeline works, and a generator that takes a stab at converting passages of text into Teeline.

The project was partially inspired by my old revision cards from when I was studying for my NCTJ diploma. Free online resources for learning Teeline seemed few and far between so once I'd cut my teeth as a software engineer I decided to try making one myself. Tinkering with it on and off over the years has seen it grow into a pretty popular resource, with thousands of visitors a month and [coverage by the likes of journalism.co.uk](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/tool-for-journalists-teeline-online-for-learning-and-practicing-shorthand/s2/a970926/).

The project is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). The outlines around which the site revolves are stored as a series of SVG path coordinates, allowing for snazzy features like animation and reusability.

## Skene

[Skene](https://github.com/gonzo-engineering/skene) is a website template intended to empower musicians to create unique, independent online presences. The idea is that if essential info - artist details, releases, lyrics, gigs, etc. - is turned into data, that data can be used to generate rich, immersive websites, giving artists fully customisable spaces of their own on the web.

Think the [Neil Young Archives](https://neilyoungarchives.com/), but for everyone. The Skene template has been used as the base for a couple of websites so far.
