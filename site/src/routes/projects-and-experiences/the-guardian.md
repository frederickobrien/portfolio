I code for _The Guardian_. I was one of the 2021 software engineering fellowship intake and am currently part of a team redesigning the homepage. I've worked with Scala, TypeScript, React, and Amazon Web Services, amongst other things.

Things worked on during my time here include...

## Feast

I was part of the 'Basecamp' team that got [Guardian Feast](https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2024/apr/17/introducing-the-feast-app) - a cooking app built around the publication's huge recipes library - off the ground. My responsibilities revolved around establishing a data model for Guardian recipes and developing a workflow for them to be structured and stored in a centralised database.

The app launched on iOS in March 2024.

## Galaxies

An ongoing project is [Galaxies (of the Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2023/feb/03/galaxies-of-the-guardian-the-formation-of-an-irregular-org-chart), an org chart that used D3 force directed graphs to represent Product & Engineering as a series of interconnected people, teams, and streams.

Although initially a side hustle Galaxies has been adopted as a go-to internal tool, expanding to cover other departments in the Guardian.

## Ophan

Spent a decent stint working on Ophan, the paper's real-time, in-house content analytics tool.

## 1821 Mode

As part of the paper's 200th birthday celebrations I and my fellow fellows made [1821 Mode](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506083228/https://1821-mode.theguardian.com/), a hack day project that styled the website to look like the first edition of the _Manchester Guardian_.

It spent a glorious week as an easter egg on the homepage and even got [a shoutout from Margaret Atwood](https://twitter.com/margaretatwood/status/1390683375720189954)!
