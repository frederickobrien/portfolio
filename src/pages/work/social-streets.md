I cut my teeth in journalism working as an editorial assistant for at _Roman Road LDN_, the then flagship publication of hyperlocal publisher Social Streets. Was responsible for news, features, social media, interviews, history... all sorts.

Personal highlights include [Frank Wang’s last stand](https://romanroadlondon.com/frank-wang-coffee-campaign-bethnal-green/), [York Hall boxing](https://bethnalgreenlondon.co.uk/york-hall-boxing-night-blood-solidarity-photoessay/), peeking the behind the doors of [fire stations](https://romanroadlondon.com/bethnal-green-fire-station/) and [police stables](https://romanroadlondon.com/bow-police-stables/), and a range of human interest pieces.

Other highlights include helping to establish the company’s patron scheme and working with immigration group [Praxis](https://www.praxis.org.uk/) to write copy for their website.
