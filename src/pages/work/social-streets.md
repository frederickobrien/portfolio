I cut my teeth in journalism working as an editorial assistant for at _Roman Road LDN_, the then flagship publication of hyperlocal publisher Social Streets. 

News, features, social media, interviews, history.

Personal highlights include Frank Wang’s stand, York Hall boxing, peeking the behind the doors of fire stations and police stables, and a range of human interest pieces.

Helped establish the company’s patron scheme.

Worked with immigration group Praxis to write copy for their new website.
