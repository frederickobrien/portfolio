I code for _The Guardian_. I was one of the 2021 software engineering fellowship intake.

Ophan, the _Guardian_'s real-time, in-house content analytics tool.

Galaxies (of the Guardian), an org chart that used D3 force directed graphs to represent the department as a series of interconnected people, teams, and streams.
