I write and edit things for _Smashing Magazine_. I am somehow its soft skills and professional development editor.

I've had the pleasure of working with NYT privacy whizzes, CSS wizards, code artists, and more.

For my part Iâ€™ve written pieces exploring the overlap between the arts and tech - newspaper design, brutalism in the realm of web design, and drawing lessons from old masters like Saul Bass and Leonardo da Vinci.
