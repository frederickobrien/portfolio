There is a Charles Bukowski poem I like called ["The Laughing Heart"](https://thebestamericanpoetry.typepad.com/the_best_american_poetry/2008/11/the-laughing-he.html) and in it are the following lines:

> be on the watch.
>
> the gods will offer you chances.
>
> know them.
>
> take them.

I'm lucky enough to have had a handful of moments in my life that those words ring true for - moments when opportunities crossed my path and I was possessed by a clarity of mind and purpose. Sometimes a thing is perfect, and you want it.

I'm not religious. I don't believe in god, destiny, fate, any of that. People get what they get rather than what they deserve, and when a good thing falls out of the sky it's certainly not because I earned it.

I do, however, think there are things that are worth caring about and things that are not, and that there is value in knowing the difference. It frees up mental energy for being on the watch.

Chances from the gods are just that - chance. What matters is whether we see them, and take them. Yet it feels fair to say that to know them we must know ourselves, which I don't credit myself with either. 

Maybe that's why those chances have a touch of the divine about them, because in their light we see ourselves clearly, recognise what we want, what would make us more whole. 

For a time it can drive you mad, but at least it occasionally drives you mad enough to take the chance. That's when the heart gets its time to laugh.
