teeline.online is an online resource for studying Teeline shorthand.

The project was partially inspired by my old revision cards from when I was studying for my NCTJ diploma. It is home to dozens of animated outlines and a 'revise' page where people can sear them into their brains.

In October 2022, [teeline.online was featured in journalism.co.uk](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/tool-for-journalists-teeline-online-for-learning-and-practicing-shorthand/s2/a970926/).
