teeline.online is an online resource for studying Teeline shorthand. Features include hundreds of animated outlines in a searchable dictionary, a 'revise' page where people can sear outlines into their brains, and a basic syllabus outlining how Teeline works.

The project was partially inspired by my old revision cards from when I was studying for my NCTJ diploma. Free online resources for learning Teeline seemed few and far between, so once I'd cut my teeth as a software engineer I decided to try making one myself.

The project is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). The outlines, around which the site revolves, are stored as a series of SVG path coordinates, allowing for snazzy features like animation and reusability.

In October 2022, [teeline.online was featured in journalism.co.uk](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/tool-for-journalists-teeline-online-for-learning-and-practicing-shorthand/s2/a970926/).
