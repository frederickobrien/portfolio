_Audioxide_ is a music webzine that I and two friends - [AndreÃÅ Dack](https://twitter.com/AndreDack) and [Andrew Bridge](https://www.andrewhbridge.co.uk/) - have run since 2015. Our core shtick has been listening to albums together and publishing our thoughts as reviews, though we also dabble in articles, interviews and other oddities.

We've reviewed more than 280 albums and counting.
