A satirical newspaper, _The Whale-Lines_ publishes stories that are almost as absurd and silly as real life.

> All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, everpresent perils of life.

I harbour ambitions of one day putting together a printed edition and distributing it at Speakers' Corner in London.
