A satirical newspaper, _The Whale-Lines_ publishes stories that are almost as absurd and silly as real life. It has been an outlet for me since _The Onion_ mysteriously doesn't respond to my emails, letters, or notes written on bricks thrown through their office window.

> 'All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, everpresent perils of life.'

I harbour ambitions of one day putting together a printed edition of the paper and distributing it at Speakers' Corner in London.
