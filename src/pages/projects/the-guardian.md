I code for _The Guardian_. I was one of the 2021 software engineering fellowship intake and am currently part of the team responsible for Ophan, the paper's real-time, in-house content analytics tool.

An ongoing project is [Galaxies (of the Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2023/feb/03/galaxies-of-the-guardian-the-formation-of-an-irregular-org-chart), an org chart that used D3 force directed graphs to represent the department as a series of interconnected people, teams, and streams.

As part of the paper's 200th birthday celebrations I and my fellow fellows made [1821 Mode](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506083228/https://1821-mode.theguardian.com/), a hack day project that styled the website to look like the first edition of the _Manchester Guardian_. It spent a glorious week as an easter egg on the homepage and even got [a shoutout from Margaret Atwood](https://twitter.com/margaretatwood/status/1390683375720189954)!

I've worked with Scala, TypeScript, React, Amazon Web Services, amongst other things.
