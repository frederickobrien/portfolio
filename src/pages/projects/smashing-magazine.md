I write and edit things for _Smashing Magazine_. I am somehow its soft skills and professional development editor. I've had the pleasure of working with NYT privacy whizzes, CSS wizards, code artists, and more.

For my part Iâ€™ve written pieces exploring the overlap between the arts and tech - newspaper design, brutalism in the realm of web design, and drawing lessons from old masters like [Saul Bass](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/saul-bass-teach-web-design/) and [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/03/leonardo-da-vinci-teach-web-design/).
